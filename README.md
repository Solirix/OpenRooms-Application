A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.


# FlutterSDK Set Up
(using vscode or vscodium)

In order to set up Flutter to work with Visual Studio Code or similar, an extension can be installed. This will allow code formatting as well as installing the SDK for you.
If this doesn't work, or you are not using this IDE, you can grab the SDK from here: https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/sdk

Cupertino (iOS) style widgets and code snippets can be found here: https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/widgets/cupertino

In order to visually test the application, you need to add the "flutter" and "dart" commands to your $PATH by following this documentation: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/linux
keep in mind that this guide is for linux machines, and that windows or macOS guides exist on the same site. your process may be different!

# Flutter is installed, now how do I run it?
Once the "flutter" command is accessible to your terminal in whatever IDE you are using, you should be able to click the run button. 
If not, simply running "flutter run" in your terminal will build and bring up the application

# If CMake errors
simply delete the entire build directory and retry the build process
